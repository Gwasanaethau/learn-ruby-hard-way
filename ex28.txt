&& (and)
|| (or)
! (not)
!= (not equal)
== (equal)
>= (greater-than-equal)
<= (less-than-equal)
<=> (spaceship: checks whether the item on the left goes before the item on the right. It returns -1 if left is less than right, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if they are in the opposite order.)

||=
	i.e.
	a ||= b
	equivalent to
	a || a = b
	(double-pipe-equals: Checks ‘a’ to see if it is true. If not, the right hand side of the comparison is executed, and ‘a’ is assigned the value of ‘b’.)

&&=
	i.e.
	a &&= b
	equivalent to
	a && a = b
	(double-ampersand-equals: Checks ‘a’ to see if it is false. If not, the right hand side of the comparison is executed, and ‘a’ is assigned the value of ‘b’.)
